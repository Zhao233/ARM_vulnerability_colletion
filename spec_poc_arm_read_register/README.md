+ what is it    
it can read all system registers' value

1. introduction     
PoC code implementing variant 3a of the Meltdown attack for AArch64. This allows reading all (potentially excluding registers whose read has side effects - not verified) system registers from user mode, including those which should only be accessible from the EL1 (kernel), EL2 (hypervisor) and EL3 (secure monitor) modes.
